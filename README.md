# AR-alpha

This project is based on AR technology. 
It uses marker based AR to detect a specific image and generate a 3D model on it. 
It uses Vuforia engine to make an efficient and compatible AR app.
When the marker image is detected, a 3D anime girl is generated on the image , which dances on the music that plays in the background.
