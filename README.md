# AR-alpha

Welcome to the AR alpha! This mobile application, developed using Unity and Vuforia, allows you to experience an augmented reality dance performance featuring a 3D girl model. The app detects an image marker and projects the 3D model onto it, accompanied by a background music and a twerking dance animation. When the image marker is removed, the dancing and music stop, and they resume from the point where they last stopped upon detecting the image marker again.

## Features

- Augmented reality dance twerk experience with a 3D girl model.
- Image marker detection using Vuforia.
- Twerking dance animation synchronized with the background music.
- Automatic resumption of dancing and music from the last stopped point upon re-detecting the image marker.
- Interactive and engaging user experience.
